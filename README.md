# Modeling Weight Lifting Exercises in Human Activity Recognition
The goal of this project (the course project on the **Practical Machine Learning** Course from **Coursera**) is to predict the manner in which six male participants perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions. Exercise is monitoring with five sensors placed like the on-body-sensing-schema [here](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/static/WLE/on-body-sensing-schema.png) and saved on the **W**eight **L**ifting **E**xercises (**WLE**) dataset.

You can see the report in the gh-pages branch [here](http://karmine.github.io/PML_Course_Project/Project.html).
